## Alert Detail



### [ Content Security Policy (CSP) Header Not Set ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10038/)



##### Medium (High)

### Description

Content Security Policy (CSP) is an added layer of security that helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks. These attacks are used for everything from data theft to site defacement or distribution of malware. CSP provides a set of standard HTTP headers that allow website owners to declare approved sources of content that browsers should be allowed to load on that page — covered types are JavaScript, CSS, HTML frames, fonts, images and embeddable objects such as Java applets, ActiveX, audio and video files.

* URL: http://localhost/
  * Node Name: `http://localhost/`
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: ``
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: ``
  * Other Info: ``
* URL: http://localhost/robots.txt
  * Node Name: `http://localhost/robots.txt`
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: ``
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: ``
  * Other Info: ``
* URL: http://localhost/sitemap.xml
  * Node Name: `http://localhost/sitemap.xml`
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: ``
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: ``
  * Other Info: ``


Instances: 3

### Solution

Ensure that your web server, application server, load balancer, etc. is configured to set the Content-Security-Policy header.

#### WASC Id: 15

#### Source ID: 3

### [ Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy Header Missing or Invalid ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/90004/)



##### Low (Medium)

### Description

Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy header is a response header that prevents a document from loading any cross-origin resources that don't explicitly grant the document permission (using CORP or CORS).

* URL: http://localhost/
  * Node Name: `http://localhost/`
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy`
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: ``
  * Other Info: ``


Instances: 1

### Solution

Ensure that the application/web server sets the Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy header appropriately, and that it sets the Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy header to 'require-corp' for documents.
If possible, ensure that the end user uses a standards-compliant and modern web browser that supports the Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy header (https://caniuse.com/mdn-http_headers_cross-origin-embedder-policy).

### Reference


* [ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy ](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy)


#### CWE Id: [ 693 ](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/693.html)


#### WASC Id: 14

#### Source ID: 3

### [ Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy Header Missing or Invalid ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/90004/)



##### Low (Medium)

### Description

Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy header is a response header that allows a site to control if others included documents share the same browsing context. Sharing the same browsing context with untrusted documents might lead to data leak.

* URL: http://localhost/
  * Node Name: `http://localhost/`
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy`
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: ``
  * Other Info: ``


Instances: 1

### Solution

Ensure that the application/web server sets the Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy header appropriately, and that it sets the Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy header to 'same-origin' for documents.
'same-origin-allow-popups' is considered as less secured and should be avoided.
If possible, ensure that the end user uses a standards-compliant and modern web browser that supports the Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy header (https://caniuse.com/mdn-http_headers_cross-origin-opener-policy).

### Reference

### [ Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy Header Missing or Invalid ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/90004/)



##### Low (Medium)

### Description

Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy header is an opt-in header designed to counter side-channels attacks like Spectre. Resource should be specifically set as shareable amongst different origins.

* URL: http://localhost/
  * Node Name: `http://localhost/`
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy`
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: ``
  * Other Info: ``


Instances: 1

### Solution

Ensure that the application/web server sets the Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy header appropriately, and that it sets the Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy header to 'same-origin' for all web pages.
'same-site' is considered as less secured and should be avoided.
If resources must be shared, set the header to 'cross-origin'.
If possible, ensure that the end user uses a standards-compliant and modern web browser that supports the Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy header (https://caniuse.com/mdn-http_headers_cross-origin-resource-policy).

### Reference


* [ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy ](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy)

### [ In Page Banner Information Leak ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10009/)



##### Low (High)

### Description

The server returned a version banner string in the response content. Such information leaks may allow attackers to further target specific issues impacting the product and version in use.

* URL: http://localhost/robots.txt
  * Node Name: `http://localhost/robots.txt`
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: ``
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: `nginx/1.27.5`
  * Other Info: `There is a chance that the highlight in the finding is on a value in the headers, versus the actual matched string in the response body.`
* URL: http://localhost/sitemap.xml
  * Node Name: `http://localhost/sitemap.xml`
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: ``
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: `nginx/1.27.5`
  * Other Info: `There is a chance that the highlight in the finding is on a value in the headers, versus the actual matched string in the response body.`


Instances: 2

### Solution

Configure the server to prevent such information leaks. For example:
Under Tomcat this is done via the "server" directive and implementation of custom error pages.
Under Apache this is done via the "ServerSignature" and "ServerTokens" directives.

### [ Permissions Policy Header Not Set ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10063/)



##### Low (Medium)

### Description

Permissions Policy Header is an added layer of security that helps to restrict from unauthorized access or usage of browser/client features by web resources. This policy ensures the user privacy by limiting or specifying the features of the browsers can be used by the web resources. Permissions Policy provides a set of standard HTTP headers that allow website owners to limit which features of browsers can be used by the page such as camera, microphone, location, full screen etc.

* URL: http://localhost/
  * Node Name: `http://localhost/`
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: ``
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: ``
  * Other Info: ``

### [ Server Leaks Version Information via "Server" HTTP Response Header Field ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10036/)



##### Low (High)

### Description

The web/application server is leaking version information via the "Server" HTTP response header. Access to such information may facilitate attackers identifying other vulnerabilities your web/application server is subject to.

* URL: http://localhost/
  * Node Name: `http://localhost/`
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: ``
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: `nginx/1.27.5`
  * Other Info: ``
* URL: http://localhost/robots.txt
  * Node Name: `http://localhost/robots.txt`
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: ``
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: `nginx/1.27.5`
  * Other Info: ``
* URL: http://localhost/sitemap.xml
  * Node Name: `http://localhost/sitemap.xml`

### [ Non-Storable Content ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10049/)



##### Informational (Medium)

### Description

The response contents are not storable by caching components such as proxy servers. If the response does not contain sensitive, personal or user-specific information, it may benefit from being stored and cached, to improve performance.

* URL: http://localhost/
  * Node Name: `http://localhost/`
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: ``
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: `no-store`
  * Other Info: ``
* URL: http://localhost/robots.txt
  * Node Name: `http://localhost/robots.txt`
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: ``
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: `no-store`
  * Other Info: ``
* URL: http://localhost/sitemap.xml
  * Node Name: `http://localhost/sitemap.xml`
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: ``
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: `no-store`
  * Other Info: ``


Instances: 3

### Solution

The content may be marked as storable by ensuring that the following conditions are satisfied:
The request method must be understood by the cache and defined as being cacheable ("GET", "HEAD", and "POST" are currently defined as cacheable)
The response status code must be understood by the cache (one of the 1XX, 2XX, 3XX, 4XX, or 5XX response classes are generally understood)
The "no-store" cache directive must not appear in the request or response header fields
For caching by "shared" caches such as "proxy" caches, the "private" response directive must not appear in the response
For caching by "shared" caches such as "proxy" caches, the "Authorization" header field must not appear in the request, unless the response explicitly allows it (using one of the "must-revalidate", "public", or "s-maxage" Cache-Control response directives)
In addition to the conditions above, at least one of the following conditions must also be satisfied by the response:
It must contain an "Expires" header field
It must contain a "max-age" response directive
For "shared" caches such as "proxy" caches, it must contain a "s-maxage" response directive
It must contain a "Cache Control Extension" that allows it to be cached
It must have a status code that is defined as cacheable by default (200, 203, 204, 206, 300, 301, 404, 405, 410, 414, 501).
